# Trie-Red-Black-Tree-and-Priority-Queue
This projects show the implementation of data structures: TRIE, RED BLACK TREE, PRIORITY QUEUE.

We know binary search tree is a good data structure to store data, but in critical conditions even it can become inefficient.
Redâ€“Black Tree is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node of the binary tree has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the color of the node. These color bits are used to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.

Trie is a tree-like data structure whose nodes store the letters of an alphabet. By structuring the nodes in a particular way, words and strings can be retrieved from the structure by traversing down a branch path of the tree.

Priority Queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.
